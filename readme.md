# Kyzenred
A full KDE theme based on gamer aesthetics and modern minimalism (Color palettes)

## Dependencies
- KDE >= 5

## Installation
This repository have two sub-directories: `color-schemes` and `konsole`.
Put the content of `color-schemes` in your `~/.local/share/color-schemes/` directory and put the content of `konsole` in your `~/.local/share/konsole/` directory.
Should any of those two doesn't exist, just make a new one!

## Usage
To sey KDE to use the official Kyzenred color scheme, just open up your KDE system manager and open the [Color](https://userbase.kde.org/System_Settings/Color) module. From there you should be able to see a "Kyzenred" entry.

To set up Konsole, you'll need to either [create a new profile or edit an existing one](https://userbase.kde.org/Konsole#Profile_Management). Under the "Appearance" tab there should be a "Kyzenred" color scheme.
